        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          I am a front-end and WordPress web developer, MERN stack enthusiast, and the founder of Epoch Web Solutions, LLC.

        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <div class="skills__about">
          <p>
            Born on Guam to a couple of salty sailors, Idaho has been my primary home since the age of two.  My formative years were pretty much dedicated to football and existing as an awkward human being frightened by most social interactions (and sharks...yep).  After high school, I experienced a humbling failure of a year in college (discipline, people, you gotta have it).  In 2002, I enlisted in the U.S. Marines, going on to serve nine years on active duty and spending time stationed in South Carolina, Japan, and Iraq.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I separated from the Marines in 2011 to pursue a college education.  During summer breaks, I worked for the Bureau of Land Management as a wildland firefighter; I saw some beautiful wilderness as a result.  After completing Idaho State University's Paramedic Science Program, I was hired as a paramedic by Ada County's only EMS transport agency.  While employed there, I was able to obtain my bachelor's degree, teach at Idaho State University's Paramedic Science Program, and I was selected to the Tactical Paramedic Team, a specialty team of nine Ada County paramedics who respond to various missions with the county's SWAT units.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Now, I code.  After dedicating much of my young adulthood to serving my community, I'm pursuing my passion.  I love to code.  It's a challenging profession, with ever-evolving technology requiring a persistent devotion to learning.  Building something as complex as an application is immensely satisfying.  While I am a relative new-comer to the web development scene, I am confident that my zeal for improvement and knowledge will lead to me becoming an exceptional and complete developer.

          <h3>WevDev Skills</h3>
          <p>
            I was first exposed to web development in 2000 as a senior in high
            school. I've dabbled here and there, committing to full-time web
            development in early 2018. My foci include traditional front-end
            languages (HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript), WordPress, and the MERN
            stack, with hopes of gaining proficiency in mobile app development
            sometime this year. I love coding, almost as much as I love the
            Philadelphia Eagles (go birds), and I look forward to tackling
            challenging builds to increase my proficiency.
          </p>

          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>
            While I am a self-taught web developer, I'm by no means academically deficient.  I have a solid educational background upon which I cultivated a passion for learning, and an eagerness to experience new challenges.  The ever and rapidly evolving landscape of web development creates the kind of environment that I know will continously and relentlessy force me to continue learning.  I love it.
